## My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a reflection of my passion for building visually appealing, high-performance web applications. This site is built using `Next.js` for its powerful server-side rendering and dynamic routing capabilities, paired with the sleek and customizable `Aceternity UI` to ensure a visually cohesive design.

For animations and delightful user interactions, I’ve integrated `Framer.js`, creating a smooth, engaging experience. The website’s responsive and modern layout is powered by `Tailwind CSS`, ensuring flexibility and performance across all devices.

To maintain the highest standards of reliability and stability, I’ve integrated `Sentry` for real-time issue tracking and error monitoring, ensuring any potential issues are swiftly addressed to keep the user experience seamless.

Together, these technologies form the backbone of a website that showcases both my technical skills and design sensibilities.
